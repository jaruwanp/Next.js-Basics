I forgot that I am using jsx not html. Thus, some of html tags I can't use.

- I accidentially drag index.js into a wrong location which supposed to be stored in "pages"... Wrong routh

- pages is the root directory


- feel like try to understand WP source code

- confused how to crate folders
- replit frozen
